    Pierogi[a][b] are filled dumplings made by wrapping unleavened dough around a savory or sweet filling and cooking in
    boiling water. They are often pan-fried before serving.

    Pierogi or their varieties are associated with the cuisines of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Dumplings
    most likely originated in Asia and came to Europe via trade in the Middle Ages.[1][2] The widely-used English name
    pierogi was derived from Polish. In some parts of Eastern Europe they are known as varenyky.[3] Pierogi are also
    popular in modern-day American and Canadian cuisine, where they are sometimes known under different local names.

    Typical fillings include potato, cheese, quark, sauerkraut, ground meat, edible mushrooms, and/or fruits. Savory
    pierogi are often served with a topping of sour cream, fried onions, or both.[4][5]</p>
